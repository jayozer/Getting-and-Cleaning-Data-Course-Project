### Original Data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers 
was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Please see the README.txt found in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphonesfor further details about this dataset. 

### Resulting clean data
Original data was tidied using run_analysis.R script and the results are in labeledDataSet variable and also outputted as tidyDataSet.txt

### Clean Data Columns

Merged training and test sets with only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation has the below columns
